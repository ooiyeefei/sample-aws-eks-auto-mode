## Overview
[Amazon EKS Auto Mode](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/auto-mode/) simplifies Kubernetes cluster management on AWS. Key benefits include:

🚀 **Simplified Management**
- One-click cluster provisioning
- Automated compute, storage, and networking
- Seamless integration with AWS services

⚡ **Workload Support**
- Graviton instances for optimal price-performance
- GPU acceleration for ML/AI workloads
- Inferentia2 for cost-effective ML inference
- Mixed architecture support

🔧 **Infrastructure Features**
- Auto-scaling with Karpenter
- Automated load balancer configuration
- Cost optimization through node consolidation

This repository provides a production-ready template for deploying various workloads on EKS Auto Mode.

## Prerequisites

🛠️ **Required Tools**
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

> **Note**: This project currently provides Linux-specific commands in the examples. Windows compatibility will be added in future updates.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone Repository**:
```bash
# Get the code
git clone -b cgk https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-eks-auto-mode.git
cd sample-aws-eks-auto-mode
```

2. **Configure LiteLLM (Optional)**:
If you plan to use LiteLLM with external providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, etc.):
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.tpl .env
```

- **Edit .env** to add your API keys (e.g., `AZURE_GPT_4O_API_KEY=your-key-here`)
- **Edit litellm-models.yaml** to configure your models:
  - Uncomment the models you want to use
  - Update the `api_base` URLs to match your Azure resources
  - The `api_key` references (e.g., `os.environ/AZURE_GPT_4O_API_KEY`) will automatically use values from your .env file

> **Note**: You can add models later by updating these files and running the update script in setup-litellm/

3. **Deploy Cluster**:
```bash
# Navigate to Terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize and apply Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Configure kubectl
$(terraform output -raw configure_kubectl)
```

**👉 Continue to: [Build Custom Image](./build-custom-image/)**

## Setup Flow

   - Create a customized OpenWebUI container image
   - Remove default branding and logos for a clean, professional appearance
   - Optimize image for your organization's requirements
   - Essential step before deploying OpenWebUI services

3. **📋 Next: OpenWebUI Setup**
   - Deploy OpenWebUI with S3 and PostgreSQL integration
   - Set up vector database with pgvector
   - Set up Apache Tika
   - Configure vLLM service (optional)

4. **🔄 LiteLLM Setup**
   - Deploy LiteLLM as a multi-provider gateway
   - Configure Redis caching and PostgreSQL tracking
   - Set up external access via ALB

5. **🔍 SearXNG Setup**
   - Deploy privacy-focused web search engine
   - Enable web search capabilities in OpenWebUI
   - Complete RAG pipeline with real-time web data

6. **📊 Observability Setup**
   - Container Insights for EKS control plane monitoring
   - Custom CloudWatch dashboards for ETCD and API server metrics
   - Cost observability with uniform tagging strategy
   - Optional KubeCost integration for Kubernetes-native cost monitoring

**👉 Next Steps:**
- **First:** [Build Custom Image](./build-custom-image/)
- **Then:** [Setup OpenWebUI](./setup-openwebui/)

## Setup Open Webui

This project includes an OpenWebUI deployment that uses:
- S3 for document storage
- RDS PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector embeddings
- AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential management
- Optional vLLM service for LLM inference

The setup process includes automated creation of the pgvector extension through a Kubernetes Job, eliminating the need for manual database configuration. Database credentials are securely managed using AWS Secrets Manager and the External Secrets Operator, following security best practices.

For detailed setup instructions, proceed to [setup-openwebui](./setup-openwebui/)

## Setup LiteLLM

This project includes a LiteLLM deployment that provides:
- Multi-provider LLM gateway with unified API
- ElastiCache Redis for caching and session management
- RDS PostgreSQL for configuration and usage tracking
- AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential management
- Cost tracking and rate limiting capabilities
- Integration with existing vLLM service

LiteLLM acts as a proxy that can route requests to multiple LLM providers (including your local vLLM service and external APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) through a single, consistent interface. This enables:

🔄 **Multi-Provider Routing**
- Route between local vLLM and external LLM APIs
- Fallback logic for high availability
- Load balancing across multiple models

📊 **Usage Tracking & Cost Management**
